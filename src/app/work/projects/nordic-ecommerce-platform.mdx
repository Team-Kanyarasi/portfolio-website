# Nordic E-commerce Platform: Scaling Fashion Retail with Modern Tech

When Nordic Fashion Co. approached us, they were struggling with an outdated e-commerce platform that was losing them sales and customers. Their existing system was slow, difficult to manage, and provided a poor mobile experience. We delivered a complete digital transformation that revolutionized their online presence.

## The Challenge

Nordic Fashion Co. faced several critical issues with their existing platform:

- **Poor Performance**: 8-second average page load times
- **Low Mobile Conversion**: Only 1.2% conversion rate on mobile devices
- **Difficult Management**: Content updates required developer intervention
- **Limited Scalability**: System couldn't handle traffic spikes during sales
- **Poor SEO**: Low search engine rankings due to technical issues

## Our Approach

We designed a comprehensive solution using modern web technologies and best practices:

### 1. Technology Stack Selection
- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring code reliability and maintainability
- **Sanity CMS**: Headless CMS for flexible content management
- **Stripe**: Secure payment processing with Nordic banking support
- **Vercel**: Global CDN deployment for fast worldwide access

### 2. Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Implemented advanced image optimization
import Image from 'next/image'

const ProductImage = ({ src, alt, priority = false }) => (
  <Image
    src={src}
    alt={alt}
    priority={priority}
    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
    className="object-cover"
    placeholder="blur"
    blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQ..."
  />
)
```

### 3. Mobile-First Design

- Touch-friendly interfaces

- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Apple Pay and Google Pay integration

const useProductSearch = (query: string, filters: ProductFilter) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['products', query, filters],
    queryFn: () => searchProducts(query, filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes cache
  })
